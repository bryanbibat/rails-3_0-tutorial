Ruby on Rails 3.0
=================
_a free student manual_

Foreword
--------

Computer Science teachers have it easy. Every time a new semester rolls in, they can simply reuse the material they've been using for years.

As a teacher of a quickly evolving web framework, I do not have that luxury.

As I write this, less than 24 hours have passed since the Rails Core team released the new version of Ruby on Rails: version 3.1.0. This means that I now have to update my student manual (i.e. this document) for upcoming classes to use this new version. Having done that before when we moved from Rails 2.3. to Rails 3.0, I know how much of this document will be changed: sections will be gutted, swaths of code rewritten, and at least one new chapter would be added.

And, yet again, I will not be paid a single cent for those updates.

So instead of just letting this nearly obsolete document go to waste, I've decided to give it away for free. 

License

This book is copyright Â© 2011 by Bryan Bibat. I still haven't decided on the appropriate license for this book. In the meantime, I'll just go with the one in Zed Shaw's excellent series [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/):

You are free to distribute this book to anyone you want, so long as you do _not_ charge anything for it, _and_ it is not altered. You must give away the book in its entirety, or not at all. This means it's alright for you to teach a class using the book, so long as you aren't charging students for the book and you give them the whole _book_ unmodified.

TODO
----

* ~~Add OSX installation steps~~ - on hold for various reasons. Submissions are welcome, though.
* Add other deployment options e.g. expand on Unicorn, mention cloud hosting, etc.
* Make another pass at the code to make sure they work.
* LaTeX all the things!
