Ruby on Rails 3.0
=================
_a free student manual_

Foreword
--------

Computer Science teachers have it easy. Every time a new semester rolls in, they can simply reuse the material they've been using for years.

As a teacher of a quickly evolving web framework, I do not have that luxury.

As I write this, less than 24 hours have passed since the Rails Core team released the new version of Ruby on Rails: version 3.1.0. This means that I now have to update my student manual (i.e. this document) for upcoming classes to use this new version. Having done that before when we moved from Rails 2.3. to Rails 3.0, I know how much of this document will be changed: sections will be gutted, swaths of code rewritten, and at least one new chapter would be added.

And, yet again, I will not be paid a single cent for those updates.

So instead of just letting this nearly obsolete document go to waste, I've decided to give it away for free.

tl;dr: I'm cool with you modifying this document in order to better suit your needs e.g. turning Aling Nena into Farmer Bob, changing the Chrome/Firefox screenshots to Safari, using Swahili instead of Tagalog in the I18n section, etc. What _isn't_ ok is modifying this work in order to sell it, profiting off it while leaving this poor third-word developer to starve. =(

TODO
----

* ~~Add OSX installation steps~~ - on hold for various reasons. Submissions are welcome, though.
* Add other deployment options e.g. expand on Unicorn, mention cloud hosting, etc.
* LaTeX all the things!
